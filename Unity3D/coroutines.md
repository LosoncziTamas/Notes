### Coroutines

- Coroutines are methods which return with an `IEnumerator` type. Coroutines are usually used with the `yield` keyword.
- They are useful because they allow you to spread tasks across several frames.
- They have nothing to do with threads, operations that run within a coroutine still execute on the main thread.
