### Light Probes

- Light baking makes your game more detailed and performant.
    - However not all objects are static.
    - Light Probes are a solution for this.
- How it works?
    - When you bake lighting then Unity will simulate real light rays bouncing around the scene.
    - Then it is turned into textures that the object will use.
    - Light Probes allow us to add certain points around our scene that will store the lighting information in that particular place.
    - Moving objects check which light probes are nearby and light themselves based on the information in those probes.
- Setup
    - Set the scene ready for baking. 
    - Mark static objects as static.
    - Mark direction light as static as well.
    - Change the lighting type to Mixed (realtime and baked)
    - This way the light will bake in all the lighting information on all static objects and still have our real time objects cast shadows.
    - Lighting settings
        - Auto generate lightmap
- Add lightprobes
    - Light/Light Probe Group
    - Distribute the probes around the scene
    - Add additional light probes where there is a lighting condition change in the scene (ex.: color, shadows)
    - Do not place them inside other objects.
- If there is any weird behaviour, turn off auto generation.
