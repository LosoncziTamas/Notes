### Digital aesthetics in UI
- Movement
  - Makes an impact on the player's attention.
- Saturation
  - Intenstity of how many colors are on the screen.
  - What text want to read? What button do you want to click?
    - Buttons are interactive and saturation should be used to make them stand out.
    - While texts should be more understated.
- Typography
  - Fonts
  - Logo, exposition, inventory descriptions.
  - Typography is important.
  - Rule of thumb: if you have a sentence stick to Sans Serif Fonts.
- Readability
- Interactivity
  - Connection between player and buttons.
  - Use specifics to help player.
- Inituitiveness
  - Thinking like the player.
  - Know your player and get a sense of how do they play.

### Sketching 
- A circular shape can be more pleasing to see for our eyes than a rectangular one.
- Border is a nice touch to show the difference between the game and the UI.
- Make the text readable.
- 
- Fade-in, fade-out pause panels.

### Beautiful transitions
- Pop UI in and out of the screen.
- To create motion use the Animation tab in Unity.
  - Create new clips.
  - Add keyframes. The animator will animate between these frames.
  - Make sure loop time is unselected so it's not looping.
- Add bouncing.
