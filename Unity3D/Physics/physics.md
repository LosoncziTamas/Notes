### "Newton's laws for rotation"

1. With no net torque, angular velocity remains constant.
2. Torque = inertia tensor * angular acceleration.
3. Every torque has an equal and opposite torque.

- The amount of torque depends on the radius.
- Torques are 90 degrees to the spin. 
- Inertia tensor is not a single number it is a matrix. And the units are kg * m^2. Because how hard to rotate something also depends on the radius (a lot). It is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal part is our main concern.
- The moment of inertia is not strictly a scalar value. It's a rank 2 tensor. (rank 0 - scaler, rank 1 - vector, rank 2 - matrix)
- There is more complexity to something that is spinning to something that's going in a straight line.
