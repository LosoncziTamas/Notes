- When the camera is set to orthographic projection the size defines the distance from the center to the top of the camera. The y dimesion of the view is twice the size of the camera. You can calculate the x dimension by using the aspect ratio of the camera. (ex.: size = 100, aspect ratio: 16:10 then the height is 200 and width is 320)
-  The orthographic settings sets the camera's viewing volume to a rectangular shape (prism).
-  In orthographic projection the objects far away from the camera don't get smaller.
