### How to actually optimize your game

- Change shadows to hard shadow, update the strength parameter to get soft shadow effect.
- Open Project Settings and switch to the `medium` preset. (or you can manually tweak the parameters)
    - Disable Anisotropic textures
    - Disable Antti Aliasing
    - Use only hard shadows
    - Change shadow resolution to medium
    - Set shadow cascades to no cascades
    - Disable VSync
- Texture maps
    - Enable `Generate Mip Maps`
    - Lower the max size
    - Use crunch compression
- Camera
    - Lower the far clipping planes if possible
- Set the environment objects to static
- Canvas
    - Select all UI elements that not clickable
        - Uncheck `Raycast Target`
        - Uncheck `Maskable`
    - Select the canvas and disable `Pixel Perfect`
- Rigidbodies
    - Set the collision detection to `Discrete`
- Android
    - Select mobile shaders and use `Mobile/VertexLit`. It is supposed to be a very efficient shader on mobile devices.
    - If you want to keep the shadows then use `Mobile/VertexLit (Noly Directional Light)`
- Shaders
    - Disable reflections
- Lighting
    - Directional Light
        - Select Mixed or Baked (if you have dynamic objects then use mixed)
        - Deactivate the dynamic objects in the scene and bake the light with the following settings:
            - Lighting Mode: Subtractive
            - Lower Lightmap Resolution 
            - Lower the Lightmap Size
            - Make sure `Compress Lightmap` is enabled.
        - Switch the Lightmapper to `Progressive GPU`
        - Generate the map
        - Select all 3d models used in the game and select `Generate Lightmap UVs` & Apply
        - Regenerate the lighting
        - Now the ambient color will only affect the dynamic objects.
- Physics
    - Disable `Auto Sync Transforms`
- Material
    - Get rid off smoothness (set to 0)
    - Disable Specular Highlights
    - Enable GPU instancing
- Sprites
    - Make sure Generate Mip Maps & Crunch compression is enabled
